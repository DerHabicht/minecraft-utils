## Minecraft Utils

These are some bash scripts that probably re-invented the wheel. The intention
was to create a couple of scripts that would automatically manage my Minecraft
servers in a more lightweight way than the server utilities I had found at the
time I started writing these. These are intended to work together with cron.
I'm still working on adding documentation.
